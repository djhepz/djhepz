- 👋 Hi, I’m @djhepz
- 👀 I’m interested in python logic and generative coding practices
- 🌱 I’m currently learning music in python, with aims of assigning/ generative signal processing outputs to geometric visual cues 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing until I have a firmer grasp of the software and an arsenal of hardware to output result.
, or if by successful woo by anyone on the same frequency.
